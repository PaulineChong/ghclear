Create a folder for your github repo in laptop.
Open folder and using gitbash type git init.
.git is created but sometimes is a hidden item.
If so, go to tick box to show hidden file.
Git add remote origin did not work as origin was used before download.
Rename origin to myorigin and main instead of master as in github min branch.

Note:  Fork does not work with own repo.
