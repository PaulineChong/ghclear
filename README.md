This homework.

Created this repo.  Not quite sure about workflow or what are we meant to see - a file that automatically churns out a diagram or a list of the commits.
But I could already see the list of commits from my repo. so what's the point.
Fork doesn't work with own repo - so need to try with others.
Question - project? what does it do?
Created a new file (name index.html) - will it not work ifwithout .html, like with  .js?
Html shows whenI go to GHpage to publish.  
GH pages now has (root) and docs ??- not shown in videos on how to and what they are.
Clearly, they haven't updated the instructions despite the update of interface. GIthub - instructions sucks!
Created files - config.yml and about.md to use Jekyll (kept names as they are) but it kept publishing the original html.
Put html into a folders and Jekyll page appears on and off.  
Root?  docs probably refer to files (created another repo and tried it out - see GHsite).
