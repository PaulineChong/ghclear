For homework and as a reminder. <br>
GIThub is like facebook. Sharing for all to see and copy.<br>
Commits = suggestions/comments/changes.
Create a repository (making a post).  
Tick with readme file (like formatting your phone).
Protect your orignal file and make branches or fork for other people.  
Make many branches to modify - different smaller portions.
Local repo - is the post you are making on your laptop. <br>
Can also make many branches in laptop too.
Cannot fork if own repo.
Then merge new changes to orignal post.<br>
Push back to github (main page on social media, called a remote). 
Push contents back to main page is deploy.<br>
Pick and choose what you want to add to your project ="pull requests",give comment to remind yourself and others.
And can delete/ break their branches.
