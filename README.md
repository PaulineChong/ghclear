For homework and as a reminder. <br>
GIThub is like facebook Hub. Sharing for all to see and copy.
Commits = suggestions/comments/changes.
Create a repository (like making project).  
Tick with readme file (like formatting your phone).
Protect your orignal file/project and make branches or fork for other people.  
Make many branches to modify - different smaller portions
Can also make branches in laptop too.
In laptop is call "local repo" - no one can see.
Cannot fork if own repo.
Then merge and push back to github (main page on social media/remote). Push is deploy.
Pick and choose what you want to add to your project ="pull requests" and give comment and send it back to them.
And can delete/ break their branches.
