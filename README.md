This homework.

Created this repo.  
Not quite sure about workflow or what are we meant to see in that file?
A file that automatically churns out a diagram or a list of the commits.  Must we make one at the start?  or will it shows past records of commits if you make file later?
Will it work with own repo?
But I could already see the list of commits from my repo. So what's the purpose? <br>
Fork doesn't work with own repo - so need to try with others.
No master  but main branch.
Created a branch and did some commits and pull requests.
Went to my black screen and did 'git remote add origin...' but origin did not work.  So change word 'origin' to 'myorigin' and it worked and master to main.
Created a new branch in my black screen, added files and wrote some remarks and push back to github on browser.  Worked.  
Changed my main repo on browser by adding some files. and html files and config and about.md  
Tried again to push to dark screen without fork.  
Not sure how to pull the updated repo in browser - is there another way besides giving another name which I did ('myorigin' to 'myrepo'). 
Question - project? 
Created a new file (name index.html) - will it not work if without '.html', like with  '.js'?
Html shows when I go to GHpage to publish.  
GH pages now has (root) and docs ??- not shown in videos on how to and what they are. 
Clearly, they haven't updated the instructions despite the update of interface. GIthub - instructions sucks.
Created files - config.yml and about.md to use Jekyll (kept names as they are) but it kept publishing the original html.
Put html into a folder and Jekyll page appears but posts did not.  
Root?  docs probably refer to files (created another repo and tried it out - see GHsite).
Purpose of doing a docker file? for own repo? or when should I use it?  or what to put in it?
